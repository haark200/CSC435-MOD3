- Download all 4 files, putting them all onto the same level of a folder (App.js, Utility.js, index.html and styles.css).
- Through some means of a live server, run the index HTML file (I personally used VS Code's live server extension).
- Now with that completed, you should have an up and runnning application through your web browser!
# Usage Tips
- Simply enough, just select a conversion from the dropdown menu (selection of 5).
- Then, enter a value into the above text box and convert using the given button at the bottom of the application box.
- The background color dropdown menu differs from the others a bit, given you can only use 0-2 for an appropriate response, otherwise an error message will occur:
0 for White,
1 for Light Blue,
2 for Red.
