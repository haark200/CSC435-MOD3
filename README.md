- Download all 3 main files and put all on the same level of a single folder(index.html, styles.css, app.js).
- Through some means of a live server, run the index HTML file (I personally used VS Code's live server extension).
- Now, the app will be functional, allowing you to use the search bar to find movies.
# After Succesful Setup
- Search any keyword of a movie you are interested in and click the "search" button (For instance, if you want an avengers movie, you can just search avengers to find all those movies).
- Then, if succesful, a list of movies with that keyword in it will appear on your screen from what was found from an IMDB movie database (Error message will occur if either no movie was found or if database didn't work).
- You then can click on any movies "view details" button to display simple information about that specific movie (Again, error message can occur if database has issue retrieving this information).
